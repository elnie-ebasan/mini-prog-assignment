                    <p>Pamplona, officially the Municipality of Pamplona, is a 3rd class municipality in the province of Negros Oriental, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 39,805 people.</p>

                    <p>Originally the place was called ‚ÄúTampa‚Äù, named after a big shady tree located at the heart of the town. The naming of the place into Pamplona has two versions:</p>

                    <p>Pamplona, then a barrio of Tanjay, was created into a municipality by virtue of Republic Act No. 535 enacted on June 16, 1950.[5] The law was authored by Pedro Bandoquillio, elected congressman in 1947. Since its creation, it has been administered by six municipal mayors. They were the late Juan Ca√±averal, Sergio Ani√±on, and late Apolinario P. Arnaiz, Sr., who managed to hold the reign for more than 22 years. After the EDSA Revolution in 1986, Douglas T. Diago was appointed as Officer In Charge, ran and won in the 1987 election and took the reign for twelve years, managing to complete his three term of mayorship from 1986 to 1998.

                    The late Wenceslao E. Duran, the undefeated politician, took hold of the administration for a brief period, after winning the 1998 election. He died of cardiac arrest while delivering his address during training in the municipality on December 18, 1999. Atty. Ricarte R. Valencia, who was then the vice mayor took office up to June 30, 2001. He ran for the post and lost in the election. Winning in the three elections in 2001. 2004 and 2007, the young, and energetic Apolinario P. Arnaiz, Jr. now reigns in his three terms of office. In the May 2010 election, the brother of Apolinario P. Arnais, Jr., Apollo P. Arnaiz who won the election and reigns in his two terms of office. In the May 2016 election, Janice Vallega Degamo won as the first lady mayor of the municipality.</p>
